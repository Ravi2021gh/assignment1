    "# Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that inherits from another class is called the derived class, subclass, or child class, and the class being inherited from is called the base class, superclass, or parent class. Inheritance promotes code reuse, allows for hierarchical relationships between classes, and enables the creation of more specialized classes based on existing ones.\n",

    "# There are several types of inheritance in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Single Inheritance:\n",
    "# Single inheritance involves a derived class inheriting from a single base class. It allows the derived class to acquire the attributes and behaviors of the base class. Here's an example:\n",
